# Credit Scoring Model Project

## Overview
This project focuses on developing a Credit Scoring Model for a buy-now-pay-later service in partnership with an eCommerce company. The dataset contains transaction records, and the aim is to analyze the data and engineer relevant features that will help in predicting credit risk.

## Notebooks

### 1. `data_cleaning.ipynb`
This notebook is responsible for cleaning the dataset to prepare it for analysis. Key steps include:
- **Loading the Data**: Importing the dataset into a DataFrame.
- **Handling Missing Values**: Identifying and imputing or removing missing values.
- **Data Type Conversion**: Ensuring that columns are of the correct data type for analysis.
- **Dropping Unnecessary Columns**: Removing columns that do not contribute to the analysis or modeling.

### 2. `EDA.ipynb`
This notebook performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the cleaned dataset. The main objectives include:
- **Overview of the Data**: Understanding the structure, number of rows, columns, and data types.
- **Summary Statistics**: Analyzing central tendency, dispersion, and distribution shape.
- **Distribution Analysis**: Visualizing numerical and categorical feature distributions to identify patterns and outliers.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Understanding relationships between numerical features.
- **Outlier Detection**: Using box plots to identify potential outliers.

## Requirements
To run the notebooks, you will need:
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn


## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Install the required packages listed in `requirements.txt`.
3. Open the notebooks in Jupyter Notebook or any compatible IDE.
4. Execute the cells in the order provided to complete the data cleaning and EDA.

## Conclusion
The outputs from the EDA and feature engineering notebooks will be utilized in subsequent modeling tasks to develop a robust credit scoring model. Your contributions and feedback are welcome!
